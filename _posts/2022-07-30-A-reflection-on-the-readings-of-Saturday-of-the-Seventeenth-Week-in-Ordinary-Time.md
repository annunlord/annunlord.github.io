In our lives we hear many voices sharing (some screaming) their worldviews and viewpoints at us. We hear these voices in the conversations with people we encounter, the TV news, newspapers, social media, email, etc. Many of these voices try to normalize opinions that would have been radical just a few years ago. And many of these voices are saying things that are directly against God, His church, and His teachings.

This is not new. In today’s readings we hear the stories of two prophets who spoke out against the actions of their leaders, their kings. Kings who had been swayed by the many godless voices of their time. Both Jeremiah and John the Baptist had to tell the leaders things they didn’t want to hear, you’re living in sin, repent and change your ways. And, because of their messages, they were persecuted.

Jeramiah had prophesied that because of the idolatry of Judah, the blatant worship of false gods, and all their ungodly behavior and sexual impurity, that God was going to allow the Babylonians to come and smite them. And that if they wanted to avert their destruction they needed to repent. At the same time Jeramiah was prophesying there were many other so-called prophets, many other voices, who also said they spoke in God’s name, who were telling the Jewish leaders what they wanted to hear. They would say that things were not as bad as Jeramiah was saying, and that God was not going to punish them because they were the chosen people. Because Jeremiah spoke up, he was persecuted.

In the gospel reading we see John the Baptist, the voice crying out in the wilderness, tell Herod that it is wrong for him to have sexual relations with his brother’s wife. John is speaking the truth, that a man should marry one woman and be faithful to her. But other religious leaders, out of fear of Herod’s power, said nothing about it, and only told Herod what he wanted to hear.

In our time, we have many voices prophesying all kinds of things. Some say we are in the end times; some say it’s time to repent, some say God loves us and condemns no one, and some say there is no god. It can be hard to discern God’s voice in the midst of many screaming voices. It is easiest to listen to the one that we agree with the most, or the safest to listen to the one that will cause us the least resistance. And so, because people like to avoid confrontation and lack courage, most of society just moves to the tune of the ones with power, the in-group, the people that control the media and movies and the laws.

How do we discern between all of these voices? How do we know when to push back? The first thing we need to do is to set our feelings aside and seek truth. When evaluating a particular subject, we should first ask about what God has revealed about the subject, and we should not be afraid of science to help us determine the truth.

Regarding something like abortion, we see that almost all society thought it was wrong a century ago; and now, more than half of our society favors it now? Even more than half of the Catholics! ([https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/10/20/8-key-findings-about-catholics-and-abortion/](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/10/20/8-key-findings-about-catholics-and-abortion/))

How did this happen? How did the societal voices change the societal beliefs? Science clearly says that a fetus is a human person, and God’s law on murder is clear. The answer is complex, people are weaker, they are more self-centered, they are pressured by the voice of the media and Hollywood to accept these beliefs, and they fall like dominos to their will. God’s voice is not the one they are listening to.

We all want to do what we want to do. We have concupiscence which encourages us seek our own pleasure; and so we seek out and find someone to tell us that what we’re doing is ok. We hang around people with like minds, people that make us feel comfortable.

And the loudest voices today are telling people that there is no God, or that God will not condemn you, no matter what you do. And many of these voices are saying the Catholic church is wrong on abortion, life, gender and marriage issues. Even some in the Catholic hierarchy. I recently heard of a parishioner, who had been an active member of our parish for many years, left this parish and is now attending a Lutheran church. The reason, they just didn’t feel welcomed in the Catholic church any more. This astounds me. Look, it is not about feelings, it is about truth, it is about listening to God’s voice, not yours, and not those of the false prophets in our society.

We need to constantly form ourselves in the teachings of the Catholic church, to constantly examine ourselves, carefully looking at our actions and beliefs that led to those actions. Always searching for the truth; and this will help us to discern the voice of God from those of the pagan culture we live in. Sometimes, God will even ask us to speak the truth to others. And this will be very difficult and dangerous, and cause people to dislike or persecute you, just ask Jeramiah or John the Baptist.

Let us ask God to help us discern His voice from all the screaming prophets of our day, and to help us to have the courage to speak the truth when it is necessary, no matter what the consequences.

St. Joseph, Diligent protector of Christ, Pray for us.
