## What is Eucharistic Adoration?
Eucharistic Adoration is a form of prayer where the faithful gather to pray in the presence of Jesus Christ in the Blessed Sacrament, which is displayed in a special vessel called a monstrance. It is a time of quiet, personal prayer, reflection, and intimacy with our Lord.

All are welcome to come and spend time with Jesus, whether for a few minutes or a full hour.

## Adoration Schedule
Perpetual Eucharistic adoration is available in our [St. Joseph's Chapel](/about/history/). Open access is available between 8AM and 9PM daily.
