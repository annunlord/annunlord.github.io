## What is Eucharistic Adoration?
Eucharistic Adoration is a form of prayer where the faithful gather to pray in the presence of Jesus Christ in the Blessed Sacrament, which is displayed in a special vessel called a monstrance. It is a time of quiet, personal prayer, reflection, and intimacy with our Lord.

All are welcome to come and spend time with Jesus, whether for a few minutes or a full hour.

## Adoration Schedule
Our parish is blessed to have Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament available in the parish chapel at the following times:

* **Tuesdays:** 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM
* **First Fridays:** Following the 12:00 PM Mass until 3:00 PM

## Become a Committed Adorer
The success of our Adoration program depends on "guardians"â€”committed adorers who sign up for a specific one-hour time slot each week. This ensures that the Blessed Sacrament is never left unattended. If you would like to commit to a regular Holy Hour, please contact the parish office.
