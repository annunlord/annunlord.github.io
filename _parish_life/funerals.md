The death of a loved one is a difficult time, and our parish community is here to support you with pastoral care and the celebration of the funeral rites. The Catholic funeral liturgy offers hope in the Resurrection and commends the soul of the departed to the mercy of God.

### Arranging a Funeral
Please contact the Parish Office at `(256) 353-2667` **before** making final arrangements with a funeral home. Our staff will help you coordinate with the priest, the music director, and the funeral home to schedule the Vigil (Wake), the Funeral Mass, and the Rite of Committal (Burial).
