Annunciation of the Lord Catholic Church was established in 1958 to serve the growing Catholic community in Decatur, Alabama. Our founding families first celebrated Mass in a small rented hall, dreaming of a permanent home where they could worship and build a community rooted in faith.

Under the guidance of our first pastor, Fr. John O'Connell, the original church building was completed and dedicated in 1961 on the very land where our parish stands today. Through the decades, our parish has grown, adding a school, expanding our church building, and fostering numerous ministries that serve both our parishioners and the wider Decatur community.

From our humble beginnings, we have been blessed with dedicated pastors, committed deacons, and generations of faithful families who have built Annunciation of the Lord into the vibrant, welcoming parish it is today. We honor our past and look with hope to our future as we continue to proclaim the Good News of Jesus Christ.
