## Are You Asking Questions About the Catholic Faith?

Whether you are just curious, coming from another Christian tradition, or have never been baptized, we are happy you are here. The Order of Christian Initiation for Adults (OCIA) is a journey of discovery for those interested in learning more about what it means to be Catholic.

### What is OCIA?
OCIA is not a "class" but a process of formation. It's a time for asking questions, learning the core beliefs of the faith, developing a prayer life, and getting to know the parish community. Participants journey together towards the sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation, and Eucharist, which are typically received at the Easter Vigil Mass.

### Who is OCIA for?
* Those who have never been baptized.
* Those baptized in another Christian faith who are now discerning entry into the Catholic Church.
* Baptized Catholics who have not yet received the sacraments of Confirmation and Eucharist.

### What is the commitment?
There is no commitment required to start the inquiry process. You are welcome to come and see, to ask your questions, and to learn with no pressure. The process typically begins in the fall and continues through the Easter season.

Our OCIA sessions meet on Thursdays from 6:30-7:30 PM, from September through April.

### How do I learn more?
If you are interested in taking the next step, we would be honored to walk with you. Please contact the Parish Office for a friendly, no-obligation conversation.
