## Welcome to Annunciation of the Lord!

We are so glad that you have chosen to make our parish your spiritual home. Whether you are new to the Decatur area or have been attending Mass here for a while, we invite you to officially register as a member of our parish family.

### Why Register?
Registering is an important expression of your commitment to our parish community. It allows us to get to know you better and to keep you informed about parish news and events. Registered parishioners can also receive contribution statements, sponsor individuals for sacraments, and enroll their children in our faith formation programs and school.

### How to Register
Registering is simple. You can download our parish registration form below, fill it out, and return it to us in one of the following ways:

1.  **Email:** Scan and email the completed form to `office@annunlord.org`.
2.  **In Person:** Drop it off at the parish office during our business hours.
3.  **Collection Basket:** Place the completed form in a sealed envelope and put it in the collection basket during any weekend Mass.
