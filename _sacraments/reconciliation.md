## What is Reconciliation?
Also known as Penance or Confession, the Sacrament of Reconciliation is God's gift of mercy. It is where we acknowledge our sins, express our sorrow, and receive the forgiveness of God through the ministry of the priest. This sacrament heals our relationship with God and the Church.

## How to Go to Confession
1.  **Examine Your Conscience:** Prayerfully reflect on your life since your last confession, calling to mind your sins.
2.  **Go to the Priest:** You may confess face-to-face or behind a screen. Begin with the Sign of the Cross.
3.  **Confess Your Sins:** Tell the priest your sins simply and honestly.
4.  **Receive a Penance:** The priest will give you a penance (prayers or actions) to help you make reparation for your sins.
5.  **Act of Contrition:** Pray an Act of Contrition, expressing your sorrow.
6.  **Receive Absolution:** The priest will extend his hands and pray the words of absolution, freeing you from your sins.
