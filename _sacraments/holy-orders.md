## What is Holy Orders?
Holy Orders is the sacrament through which the mission entrusted by Christ to his apostles continues to be exercised in the Church until the end of time. It is the sacrament of apostolic ministry. It includes three degrees: episcopate (bishops), presbyterate (priests), and diaconate (deacons).

## Discerning a Vocation
A vocation is a call from God to a particular state in life: marriage, single life, religious life, or the priesthood. Discerning a vocation requires prayer, spiritual direction, and an openness to God's will.

If you feel that God may be calling you to serve the Church as a priest or deacon, we encourage you to speak with one of our parish priests. They would be honored to accompany you on your journey of discernment.

## Contact for Vocations
For more information about vocations to the priesthood and religious life in our diocese, please visit the [Diocese of Birmingham Vocations Office](https://bhmdiocese.org/vocations) or speak with one of our priests.
