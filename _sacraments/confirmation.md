## What is Confirmation?
Confirmation completes the grace of Baptism. It is the sacrament which gives us the Holy Spirit in a special way, in order to root us more deeply as children of God, incorporate us more firmly into Christ, strengthen our bond with the Church, associate us more closely with her mission, and help us bear witness to the Christian faith in words accompanied by deeds.

## Requirements for Confirmation
* **For Youth:** Our program is typically for students in the 8th grade who have been baptized and have received their First Holy Communion. Consistent participation in religious education is required.
* **For Adults:** Baptized adults who have not been confirmed participate in a special preparation program. Please contact the office for details.

## The Process at Our Parish
Our youth Confirmation program is a two-year process beginning in the 7th grade. It involves classes, a retreat, service hours, and choosing a sponsor and a Confirmation name. The sacrament is typically conferred by the Bishop in the spring.
