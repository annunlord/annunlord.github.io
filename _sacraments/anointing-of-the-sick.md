## What is Anointing of the Sick?
This sacrament of healing is administered to bring spiritual and even physical strength during a grave illness or in old age. It is a source of peace and courage, uniting the suffering person with the Passion of Christ and offering forgiveness of sins.

## Who Can Receive It?
Any baptized Catholic who is facing serious illness, preparing for major surgery, or experiencing significant health challenges due to advanced age can receive this sacrament. It can be received more than once if the person's condition worsens or if they recover and fall gravely ill again.
