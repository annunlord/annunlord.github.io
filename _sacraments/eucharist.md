## What is the Eucharist?
The Holy Eucharist is the source and summit of the Christian life. It is the sacrament of the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ, under the appearances of bread and wine. In the Eucharist, we are spiritually nourished, our venial sins are forgiven, and we are more deeply united to Christ and His Body, the Church.

## First Holy Communion
Preparation for First Holy Communion is a two-year process, typically beginning in the 1st grade. Children must be baptized and participate in our parish's religious education program.

## For the Homebound
If you or a loved one are unable to attend Mass due to illness or age and would like to receive the Eucharist at home, please contact the parish office to arrange for a visit from an Extraordinary Minister of Holy Communion.
