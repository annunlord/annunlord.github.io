## What is Matrimony?
The Sacrament of Matrimony is a lifelong covenant, by which a man and a woman establish between themselves a partnership for the whole of life. This sacred bond is a visible sign of the love that Christ has for His Church. It is ordered toward the good of the spouses and the procreation and education of children.

## Requirements for Marriage
* One or both members of the couple should be a registered, active member of Annunciation of the Lord parish.
* Both must be free to marry in the Catholic Church. If either party has been previously married, no wedding date can be set until a declaration of nullity (annulment) has been granted.

## The Process at Our Parish
Couples wishing to be married must contact a priest or deacon at least **six months** prior to their desired wedding date. This time is required for marriage preparation, which includes meetings with clergy, attending a pre-Cana program, and completing the necessary paperwork.

## Contact Us
To begin the marriage preparation process, please contact the parish office at `(256) 353-2667`.
