# The Sacrament of Baptism

The Sacrament of Baptism is one of the Seven Sacraments of the Christian Church. It is usually the first Sacrament received and considered the “door” of the Church. Baptism is the sacrament of regeneration by water in the Word. Christ was Baptized in the Jordan and declared the necessity of this “rebirth” to Nicodemus and sent His Apostles and disciples to preach and baptize.

Parents seeking Baptism for their child are asked to attend a Pre-Baptismal session. Sessions in English are usually held on a Saturday at 3:00 PM in the Parish Library.
