## What is Baptism?
Baptism is the first sacrament of Christian Initiation. It is the gateway to life in the Spirit and the door which gives access to the other sacraments. Through Baptism we are freed from sin and reborn as children of God; we become members of Christ, are incorporated into the Church, and are made sharers in her mission.

## Requirements for Baptism
* **For Infants:** Parents must be registered members of the parish. Godparents must be confirmed, practicing Catholics in good standing with the Church.
* **For Adults:** Adults seeking Baptism participate in the Order of Christian Initiation for Adults (OCIA).

## The Process at Our Parish
1.  **Contact the Parish Office:** Please call the office to express your interest and receive initial information.
2.  **Attend a Preparation Class:** Parents are required to attend a Baptismal preparation class. These are held on the first Tuesday of every month.
3.  **Schedule the Baptism:** Once the class is complete and all paperwork has been submitted, the Baptism can be scheduled. Baptisms are typically celebrated after the 10:30 AM Mass on Sundays.

## Contact Us
